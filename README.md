- 👋 Hi, I’m @paulinamarczak
- 👀 I’m interested in coding to save the world! Woohoo!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that every line of code can become a function. Gotta clean that code!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool new GISy ideas! Do you have an interactive map application that needs to be developed? Contact me! Here's an example for a current client that is still being actively developed: https://www.pathwaystocare.ca/map
